# PyTorch research

It's repo is under development. I put here code from my another project so
it should contain some redundant features. There is some untested code as well.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Prerequisites are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
To install them use

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
pip install pytorchresearch
```

## Running the tests

We use `pytest` as testing framework for the project. To run tests:

```
pytest
```
